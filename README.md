# relationships

A small project to generate a diagram that explains the nomenclature of family
relationships.

In this project is an [ASCII file](relations.dot) (the `dot` file) with source
code for the [dot](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/doc/info/lang.html)
language of the [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) project.

The [spreadsheet](relations.odc) was used to calculate the color-values that
were then hand-copied into the `dot` file.
